# How to push code project to github repository from vscode terminal
Welcome to the documentation for Git and Github! This document is designed to provide a comprehensive guide on how to push code to Github, effectively use Git stash, and work with branches on Github.
## Introduction
This guide will show you how to use Git and Github. Git is a version control software designed to help developers. We use git to create repositories of our code. Github is a website that stores and hosts our code for others to see. This guide documents how to send to a remote repository (in this case, Github). This guide will also show you how to use Git Stash to temporarily save changes that you have made to your working directory and index, without committing them to your Git repository. This guide was written for Windows 10 or 11.
