## Repository
A repository is a storage location (folder) that contains all the files for a project. It commonly referred to as a repo.
## Local
Local is a term used to refer to our computer. When using Git we often have a local repo stored on our computer as well as a remote repo stored elsewhere (Typically Github).
## Remote
Remote is used when referring to a location that is not local. We commonly refer to Github as a remote repository because it is not hosted on our computer.
## Push
We use the word push to refer to when we send our local repo to a remote repo. For instance when we send the code in our local repo to Github we are pushing our code to Github.
## Pull
Pull is the opposite of push. We use pull to refer to when we download code from a remote repo to our computer and store it in our local repo. For instance when we download code from Github to our computer we are pulling code from Github.
## Commit
Commit is a term used to refer to when we save our changes to our local repo. We need to commit our changes as Git does not automatically.
